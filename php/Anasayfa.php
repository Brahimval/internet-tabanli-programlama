          <p>Default text Fairy Tales are stories involving 
            fantastic forces, usually good versus evil, most
             originating in folklore, mythology, and legend.
              They feature fantasy beings like dragons, dwarfs,
               fairies and talking animals. They aren't just for kids.
                In fact, many are complex morality tales; some are graphi
                c or morbid, and shouldn't be read to children at all. 
                We recommend previewing stories before reading with your children.</p>
